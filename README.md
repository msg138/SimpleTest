# SimpleTest

I am making Unit Testing frameworks for my personal use. I plan to make different ones for multiple programming languages, they will have similar function names if not the same. This is more of an educational process for me, in case if you are wondering why I am reinventing the wheel.

## Current Implementations

- **JavaScript** - [SimpleTestJS](JS/README.md)

### Planned Implementations

- **C** / **C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**

## Authors

- **Michael George** - *Initial work* - [MSG138](https://github.com/msg138)
